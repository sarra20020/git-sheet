- commit
 `git commit -m "message"` 
- shortcut for staging and committing
  `git commit -a -m"message"`
- list all branches existing in the current directory (CD)
  `git branch`

### Branching

- create a new branch
  ` git checkout -b <branch-name>` > will not swith to the created branch.

- once you have created a new branch, we can switch to it
  ` git switch <branch-name>` or ` git checkout <branch-name>` > to create a branch and switch on it ` git switch -c <branch-name>` or ` git checkout -b <branch-name>`

- delete a branch
  ` git branch -D <branch-name>` > we have to be into another branch while trying to delete a branch
- rename a branch
  ` git branch -m <branch-name>`

  > we should be within the branch we want to rename

- push the new created local branch with his content
  `git push --set-upstream origin <branch_name>`

### Merging

- combine two branch, move to the destination branch and then use the following cmd
  ` git merge <branch-name>` > A fast-forward merge can occur when there is a linear path from the current branch tip to the target branch. > In the event that you require a merge commit during a fast forward merge for record keeping purposes you can execute git merge with the --no-ffoption. `git merge --no-ff <branch-name>`

### Diff

- view changes between commits, branches, files , our working dir ... etc itshow the difference between new changes and the last commit
  `git diff` without additionnal options, it will list all hte changes in our working dir that are Not staged for the next commit

  > `git diff --staged` or `git diff --cached` will only list the changes that are staged, and to view for a particular field we can add the specific <file_name> in option as `git diff HEAD [file_name]` or compare two files `git diff [file_name_1] [file_name_2]`

- `git diff branch1..branch2` || `git diff branch1 branch2` will list the changes between the tips of branch1 and branch2

  > `git diff commit1..commit2` || `git diff commit1 commit2` to compare two commits , provide git diff with the commit hashes of the commits in question (i.e git diff 4eb57y 5oyeij) the order matter

  > `git diff HEAD ` lists all changes in the working tree since your last commit

### Stashing

> Git provide an easy way of stashing these uncommited changes so that we can return to them later, without having to make unnecessary commit

- ` git stash` or ` git stash save` put stuff in the stash (running this command will take all uncommited changes (stages or unstaged) and stash them , reverting the changes in your working copy )
- ` git stash pop` remove the most recently stashed changes in your stash and re-apply them your working copy
- `git stash apply` to apply whatever is stashed away , without removing it from the stash .This can be useful if you want to apply stashed changes to multiple branches
- `git stash list` display all existing stashes, Git assume you want to apply the most recent stash when you run `git stash apply` , but you can also specify a particular stash like `git stash apply stash@{id}`
- `git stash drop stash@{id}` to delete a particular stash
- `git stash clear` will clear all stashes

### Checkout and Time travelling

- `git checkout <commit-hash>` will detach the head and point it to this particular commit
  > `git switch <branch_name>` will re-atach our head to branch name
- `cat .git/HEAD` see the commit our head is referring to
- ` git checkout HEAD <file_name>` or `git checkout -- <file_name>` will discard new changes added to the file name and will back to whatever it looked like in your last commit a.k.a where HEAD is still referencing
- `git restore <file_name>` is a new git Git brand command that helps wit un doing operations.Its restore using HEAD as the default source , but we can change that using the `--source ` option
- `git restore --source HEAD~2 <file(s)_name>` or `git restore --source <commit-hash> <file(s)_name>` will restore file(s) prior to the last 2 second commit
- If you have accidentally added file to your stagging area with `git add` and you don't wish to include it to the next commit ,we can use ` git restore` as well to remove it from the staging area ---> `git restore --staged <file_name>`
- `git reset`
  > Regular reset : `git reset <commit-hash>` will reset the repo back to a specific commit without changing files content
  > Hard reset : `git reset --hard <commit-hash>` (`git reset --hard HEAD~1` for the 1st commit ahead of HEAD) will delete the specific commit and associated changes
- `git revert ` similar to `git reset` it creates a brand new commit which reverses/undos the changes from a commit
  > `git revert` or `git reset` : If we want to reverse some commits that other people already have on their machines , we should use _revert_ if not shared yet we should use _reset_(and no one will ever know)

### Authors management

- `git log --format='%aN'` this will show all unique authors in the repository history
- `git shortlog -nse` for more detailed output
- `git log --author="Author Name"` to show commits from a specific author or just using a part of the name: `git log --author="John"`
- `git shortlog -sn` to show how many commits each author made a,d to group commits by author `git shortlog -nse`

### Tagging

- `git tag` Listing the existing tags in Git is straightforward. Just type git tag (with optional -l or --list)
- You can also search for tags that match a particular pattern `git tag -l "v1.8.5*"`
- Git supports two types of tags: *lightweight* and *annotated*.
- Creating an annotated tag in Git is simple. The easiest way is to specify -a when you run the tag command `git tag -a v1.4 -m "my version 1.4"`
- You can see the tag data along with the commit that was tagged by using the git show command `git show v1.4`
- Another way to tag commits is with a lightweight tag. This is basically the commit checksum stored in a file — no other information is kept `git tag v1.4-lw`
- Now, suppose you forgot to tag the project at v1.2, which was at the “Update rakefile” commit. You can add it after the fact. To tag that commit, you specify the commit checksum (or part of it) at the end of the command: `git tag -a v1.2 9fceb02`
- By default, the git push command doesn’t transfer tags to remote servers. You will have to explicitly push tags to a shared server after you have created them. This process is just like sharing remote branches — you can run `git push origin <tagname>`
- If you have a lot of tags that you want to push up at once, you can also use the --tags option to the git push command. This will transfer all of your tags to the remote server that are not already there `git push origin --tags`
- `git push <remote> --tags` will push both lightweight and annotated tags
-  if you use `git push <remote> --follow-tags` only annotated tags will be pushed to the remote
-  Delete Tags `git tag -d <tagname>` Note that this does not remove the tag from any remote servers. There are two common variations for deleting a tag from a remote server.
The first variation is `git push <remote> :refs/tags/<tagname>`  The second (and more intuitive) way to delete a remote tag is with `git push origin --delete <tagname>`

## GitHub

- Definition : _GitHub_ is a hosting platform for git repositories , meanwhile _Git_ is a version control software that runs locally on your machine, no account, no internet needed to use git.

- `git clone` is a git _not github_ command to fetch a remote repo to local file

### configuring SSH keys (ref docs: https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent)

- first of all we need to veriry if there's existing ssh keys
  so we tap the command `ls -al ~/.ssh`
- if no ssh keys available you can generate a new one :
  > open a terminal
  > `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"`
  > Note: If you are using a legacy system that doesn't support the Ed25519 algorithm, use: `ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"`
- Start the ssh-agent in the background
  > `eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"`
- Check if your ~/.ssh/config file exists in the default location
  > open ~/.ssh/config or cd ~/.ssh/config if the file doesn't exist we could create a new one with `touch ~/.ssh/config`
  > follow the docs for more details.

### Viewing remotes

- `git remote or git remote -v` will list any existing remotes that we can run in our dir
  > this command command will display nothing in case no remote repos is present in the current dir
  > `git remote add <name> <url>` to add a new remote ex: _git remote add origin https;//github.com/blah/repo.git_ > **Origin** is a conventional Git remote name, can be changed
  > `git remote rename <old> <new> ` to rename a remote
  > `git remote remove <name>` will delete a remotes
  > `git branch -r` to view remote branches our repository knows about

### Pushing your work

- **`git push <remote> <branch>`** ex : _git push origin main_

### Checking out remote branches

- Usually when we clone a repo we only get the default branch in the local dir , by using _git branch -r_ we can see all existing remotes branches but not tracked locally
  > `git switch <branch-name>` better than `git checkout --track origin/<branch-name>` will set up my branch locally

### Fetching

- Fetching allow us to download changes from a remote repo, BUT thos changes will not be automatically integrated into our working files. It let you see what others have been working on , without having to merge those changes into your local repo.
  > `git fetch <remote>` command fetches branches and history from a specific remote repo. It only updates remote tracking branches.
  > `git fetch origin` would fetch all changes from the origin remote repo. We can also fetch a specific branch from a remote using `git fetch <remote> <branch>`
  > Helps to check others work without applying it locally to see changes we can use `git checkout origin/<branch>`

### Pulling

- **`git pull`** is another command we can use to retrieve changes from a remote repository. Unlike fetch , pull actually update HEAD branch with whatever changes are retrieved from the remote. it's like a _git push = git fetch + git merge_
- To pull we specify the particular remote and branch we want too pull using `git pull <remote> <branch>`. Just like git merge , it matters WHERE we run this comand from.Whatever branch we run it from is where the chnagess will be merged into.
- `git pull origin master` would fetch latest information from the origin's master branch and merge those changes into our current branch.
- if we run `git pull` without specifying a particular remote or branch to pull from , git assumes the folowwing :
  > remote will default to origin
  > branch will default to whatever tracking connection is configured for your current branch
  > **Note**: This behavior can be configured, and tracking connections can be changed manually, Most of people don't mess with that stuff

### GitHub workflow

- It's recommended to work with multiple branches while working in a team of lot of developers (since each contributor will make his own experiment, test, fix bugs), and then merge everything on a specific branch!
- _Pull Request_ are feature built in to products like GitHub and Bibucket. They are not native to Git itself
